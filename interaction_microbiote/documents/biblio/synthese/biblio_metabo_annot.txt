From Network Analysis to Functional Metabolic Modeling of the Human Gut Microbiota
    review

    1-build an interaction network on correlation matrix of species
    2-genome scale metabolic reconstitution to build metabolic network (GEM)

    -provide a list of tools for constraint-based modeling of microbial communities
        3 types : (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5872302/table/tab2/?report=objectonly)
            -compartment based models
            -population-based models
            -individual based model

    -simplified microbiota models (10 species)

Understanding the interactions between bacteria in the human gut through metabolic modeling

    simple models (done on 3 species)
        models of 1 bacteria or 2
    here they start with the genome scale metabolic reconstitution
